// TODO:

- Implement nuklear
- Implement input system
- Improve camera system

- Vertext Colors for models (to use as ao or fog)
- Vertext lighting
- Toggable Z buffer issues (idk if its possible but still would be cool)
- Add option to reduce passive jitter (as it wasnt common in ps1 games with static objects, it was artifact of GTE)
- Add option to switch between flat shading and Gouraud shading.
- Add billboard rendering
- Add particle system

- Add gui rendering with nuklear (add .gui system for abstratcting gui creation)
