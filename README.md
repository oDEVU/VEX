# VEX
 Game engine made in vulkan that aim to replicate feel of ps1 era games.


// TODO:

- Vertext Colors for models (to use as ao or fog)
- Vertext lighting
- Toggable Z buffer issues (idk if its possible but still would be cool)
- Add option to reduce passive jitter (as it wasnt common in ps1 games with static objects, it was artifact of GTE)
- Add option to switch between flat shading and Gouraud shading.
