# VEX (Vulkan Early eXperiences)
 Game engine made in vulkan that aim to replicate feel of ps1 era games. Main goal of the project is to learn graphics programming without complicationg my life with PBR, etc. But still build somethink 'cool'.


// TODO:

- UI rendering
- Virtual file system for asset packing
- Scene system (so object wont need ti me manually added to main.cpp, esentialy abstrasting that part with graphics editor late on)

- Vertext Colors for models (to use as ao or fog)
- Vertext lighting
- Toggable Z buffer issues (idk if its possible but still would be cool)
- Add option to reduce passive jitter (as it wasnt common in ps1 games with static objects, it was artifact of GTE)
- Add billboard rendering
- Add particle system
