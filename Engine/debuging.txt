# VEX Engine: Production Debugging Guide

When a user experiences a crash in a **Distribution** or **Release** build, we do not ship debug symbols with the binary to keep the size small and protect IP. Instead, we use "Post-Mortem Debugging" by matching the user's **Crash Log** with the **Debug Symbols** stored on our build server.

---

## 1. Required Artifacts

To solve a crash, you need two things:

### A. The Crash Log (from the User)

**Location:** `Engine/logs/game_session.log` on the user's machine.
Look at the very end of the file for the header: `========== CRASH OCCURRED ==========`.

### B. The Debug Symbols (from our Build Server)

**Location:** * **Distribution Builds:** `Build/Symbols/Distribution/<Timestamp>/`

* **Local Release Builds:** `Build/Symbols/Release/Latest/`

**Files to look for:**

* **Linux:** `libGameModule.so.debug` or `libVEX.so.debug`
* **Windows:** `GameModule.pdb` or `VEX.pdb`

## 2. Reading the Log

Open the user's `game_session.log`. You need to find the **Crash Address** and the **Base Address** for the specific module that crashed (e.g., `libGameModule.so`).

```text
========== CRASH OCCURRED ==========
Reason: SIGSEGV
Absolute Crash Address: 0x7f75d73bc7f0   <--- [1] CRASH ADDRESS

... (CPU Registers) ...

--- MEMORY MAP ---
7f75d7200000-7f75d7400000 r-xp ... libGameModule.so  <--- [2] BASE ADDRESS
...

```

1. **Crash Address:** The memory location where the failure occurred.
2. **Base Address:** The starting address where the OS loaded that specific library. Use the **first** address on the line containing the module name.

---

## 3. Calculating the Offset

Operating systems use ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization). To find the source code line, we must calculate the **Relative Offset**.

**Formula:** `Offset = Crash Address - Base Address`

**Example:**

* **Crash:** `0x7f75d73bc7f0`
* **Base:** `0x7f75d7200000`
* **Offset:** `0x1bc7f0`

*(Tip: In a Linux terminal, you can calculate this with: `printf "0x%x\n" $((0x7f75d73bc7f0 - 0x7f75d7200000))`)*

---

## 4. Locating the Source Line

Once you have the **Offset**, use our symbol files to find the code.

### On Linux (addr2line)

Run this in your terminal:
`addr2line -e <PathToDebugFile> <Offset>`

**Example:**
`addr2line -e Build/Symbols/Distribution/2025-12-30_03-00/libGameModule.so.debug 0x1bc7f0`
**Result:** `Source/Vehicle.cpp:88`

### On Windows (llvm-symbolizer)

If you have LLVM/Clang tools installed:
`llvm-symbolizer --obj=<PathToPDB> <Offset>`

**Example:**
`llvm-symbolizer --obj="Build\Symbols\Distribution\2025-12-30_03-00\GameModule.pdb" 0x1bc7f0`
**Result:** `D:\VEX\Source\Vehicle.cpp:88:12`

## Summary Checklist for Developers

1. [ ] Get `game_session.log` from user.
2. [ ] Find the matching symbols in `Build/Symbols/Distribution/`.
3. [ ] Subtract **Base Address** from **Absolute Crash Address**.
4. [ ] Run `addr2line` or `llvm-symbolizer` with the resulting **Offset**.
