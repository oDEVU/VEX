compile and use projectBuilder under "Engine/BuildTools/", pass to it the path to the project directory. It will create "Build" directory inside the project directory. The "Build" directory will contain the compiled output of the project.

CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS FOR LINUX, WINDOWS IS UNTESTED BUT MOST PROBABLY projectBuilder WILL DELETE VEX.dll AS IT ONLY CHECKS FOR libVEX.a
