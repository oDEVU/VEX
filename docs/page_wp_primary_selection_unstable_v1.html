<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="page_desc_wp_primary_selection_unstable_v1"></a>
Description</h1>
<p>This protocol provides the ability to have a primary selection device to match that of the X server. This primary selection is a shortcut to the common clipboard selection, where text just needs to be selected in order to allow copying it elsewhere. The de facto way to perform this action is the middle mouse button, although it is not limited to this one.</p>
<p>Clients wishing to honor primary selection should create a primary selection source and set it as the selection through wp_primary_selection_device.set_selection whenever the text selection changes. In order to minimize calls in pointer-driven text selection, it should happen only once after the operation finished. Similarly, a NULL source should be set when text is unselected.</p>
<p>wp_primary_selection_offer objects are first announced through the wp_primary_selection_device.data_offer event. Immediately after this event, the primary data offer will emit wp_primary_selection_offer.offer events to let know of the mime types being offered.</p>
<p>When the primary selection changes, the client with the keyboard focus will receive wp_primary_selection_device.selection events. Only the client with the keyboard focus will receive such events with a non-NULL wp_primary_selection_offer. Across keyboard focus changes, previously focused clients will receive wp_primary_selection_device.events with a NULL wp_primary_selection_offer.</p>
<p>In order to request the primary selection data, the client must pass a recent serial pertaining to the press event that is triggering the operation, if the compositor deems the serial valid and recent, the wp_primary_selection_source.send event will happen in the other end to let the transfer begin. The client owning the primary selection should write the requested data, and close the file descriptor immediately.</p>
<p>If the primary selection owner client disappeared during the transfer, the client reading the data will receive a wp_primary_selection_device.selection event with a NULL wp_primary_selection_offer, the client should take this as a hint to finish the reads related to the no longer existing offer.</p>
<p>The primary selection owner should be checking for errors during writes, merely cancelling the ongoing transfer if any happened.</p>
